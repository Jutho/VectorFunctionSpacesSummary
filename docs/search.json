    "title": "Chapter 3 — Linear operators and eigenvalues",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\nThis chapter discusses general properties of vector space endomorphisms = linear operators = linear maps from a vector space to itself. Operators can be composed with themselves, giving rise to powers and polymials. This is important to then also introduce eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and finally, to generalise arbitrary scalar functions (\\(f:\\mathbb{C}\\to \\mathbb{C}\\)) to operators/square matrices. Parts of this will be repition (projectors, eigenvalues, …), other parts will be new (generalised eigenspaces, Jordan form, functions of operators).\n\n\nNot convered in class\n\nSection 3.2.5 (Jordan normal form) was only covered to give the end result, namely the specific structure of the Jordan normal form, without the “proof” or “recipe” of how it is obtained. You need to be able to use the Jordan form in applications, or in other theoretical constructions (like how to apply functions to it), but no proofs from section 3.2.5 need to be known.\nSection 3.2.6 (Sensitivity of eigenvalues and eigenspaces) was covered, but only gives a flavor of the difficulties related to the study of how the Jordan normal form changes under small perturbations. It does not contain any formal results, theorems or proofs.\nSection 3.3.3 (Derivatives of matrix functions) was not discussed at all in class, and thus does not need to be known.\nSection 3.4 was covered, but rather quickly, and mainly with how it should be used in applications and exercises (see below). There will be no theory questions from Section 3.4, but solving linear recurrence relations or differential equations is an important skill for the exercises.\n\n\n\nImportant concepts\n\nProjector and its relation to direct sum\nPolynomial of a matrix, annihilating polynomial, minimal annihilating polynomial\nEigenvalue, eigenvector, eigenspace, spectrum, geometric multiplicity, algebraic multiplicity, characteristic polynomial, spectral decomposition (= eigenvalue decomposition = diagonalisation), spectral projector, diagonalisable versus defective matrix\nInvariant subspace, generalised eigenspace, Jordan normal form\nCompanion matrix, eigenvectors of the companion matrix =&gt; diagonalised by Vandermonde matrix (not the generalisation for the case where eigenvalues coincide and the companion matrix is defective)\nStructure of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for real matrices\nLeft eigenvector and its relation to the dual of the linear operator\nFunction of an operator/matrix, matrix exponential, matrix logarithm and powers\n\n\n\nLemmas, propositions and theorems\nProofs to most lemmas and propositions are rather short and/or constructive and need to be known. Excluded from this is the construction of the Jordan normal form (Subsection 3.2.5).\nImportant constructive proofs (active knowledge):\n\nProposition 3.3: projector versus direct sum\nProposition 3.4\nProposition 3.7, 3.8 and corollary 3.9: linear independence of different eigenvectors\nProposition 3.10: eigenvalues of \\(\\hat{A}\\circ\\hat{B}\\) vs \\(\\hat{B}\\circ \\hat{A}\\)\nProposition 3.11: characteristic polynomial of a companion matrix\nTheorem 3.13: common spectral decomposition of commuting operators\n\nLonger proofs (passive knowledge):\n\nTheorem 3.12: Cayley Hamilton: passive knowledge of proof (understand but not reproduce)\nProposition 3.15: sequences of invariant subspaces\nTheorem 3.16: decomposition of \\(V\\) in invariant subspaces, interpretation of and relation between different indices \\(q_\\lambda\\), \\(r_\\lambda\\) and \\(s_\\lambda\\)\nProposition 3.19: Jordan decomposition of companion matrix\n\n\n\nFor applications / exercises\n\nUsing Cayley-Hamilton theorem\nComputing eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nComputing a matrix function via eigenvalue or Jordan decomposition\nSolving an (autonomous linear) initial value problem or recurrence relation (in particular, for the higher-order scalar case: Remark 3.62 and 3.69)"

    "text": "Summary\nThis chapter introduces the concept of a norm, and then discusses at length how this can be used to make sense of limits of sequences of vectors, mostly in infinite-dimensional vector spaces, where there are some surprises and not everything is very intuitive. Then, we discuss the implications for linear maps on such normed vector spaces.\n\n\nNot covered in class\nSection 4.4.1 was only discussed at high level. In section 4.4.2, I only mentioned the definition of the condition number. The contents of this section should be more or less equivalent to what is covered in Python 4 Scientists. If you are not following this course, it might be useful to read about the importance of the condition number.\nSection 4.4.3 was not discussed at all.
