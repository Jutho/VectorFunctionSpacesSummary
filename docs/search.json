    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\nThis chapter discusses general properties of vector space homomorphisms = linear maps, and in particular their representation as matrices in the case of finite-dimensional vector spaces. Most of this chapter should be repition, some parts are probably new (linear functionals and dual space, antilinear maps, determinants and inverses of block matrices). This chapter contains several important general concepts that you need to be able to actively use for both the theory and exercise exam.\n\n\nNot convered in class\nSection 2.5.4 (Double dual space) and Section 2.7.3 (Conjugate vector space) have not been covered in class.\n\n\nImportant concepts\n\nLinear map, property of linearity (\\(=\\) additivity + homogeneity), composition, identity\nKernel (\\(=\\) null space), image (\\(=\\) range), rank, nullity\nMatrix, matrix representation of a linear map\nLinear extensions\nMatrix multiplication, transpose, hermitian conjugate, (anti)symmetric and (anti)Hermitian matrix\nDeterminant (Leibniz formula) and trace\nAdjugate and inverse matrix, singular matrix (\\(=\\) zero determinant) and nonsingular matrix\nJacobi’s formula for the derivative of a determinant\nGeneral linear group (\\(=\\) invertible matrices), basis transform \\(=\\) similarity transform\nLinear functional, dual space (\\(=\\) linear functionals), basis transform of linear functional, dual linear map (\\(\\cong\\) matrix transpose)\nInterpretation of complex linear maps and vice versa; antilinear map\nSystem of linear equations, homogeneous and inhomogeneous, over- and underdetermined, upper and lower triangular matrix, LU decomposition\nBlock matrices, block-LDU decomposition and Schur complements, Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity\n\n\n\nLemmas, propositions and theorems\nSeveral of the propositions that are repititions of last year were not explicitly proven in the class. The most important propositions and theorems that we have given some attention and have proven in class are\n\nTheorem 2.11: Rank-nullity theorem \\(=\\) dimension theorem (together with proposition 2.10 which precedes it, and corollary 2.12)\nProposition 2.13: column rank = row rank (together with corollary 2.14)\nProposition 2.24: Jacobi’s formula\nProposition 2.30: Woodbury’s identity\n\n\n\nFor applications / exercises\n\nComputing determinant of jacobian for integration measures\nUsing Gaussian elemination, Schur complements, Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula"

    "text": "Summary\nThis chapter lists the basic mathematical structures and terminology that we will need and use, and doing so, also specifies the convention and notations that we will use for those. This should be almost completely repition; there will be no direct theory questions about this, but you should of course be able to use and understand this terminology\n\n\nNot convered in class\nSection 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 were only partially covered in class. We have only introduced group actions (and representations as special case), but not discussed the different properties it can have (faithful, free, transitive), nor the associated concepts of orbits and stabilizer subgroups. We have discussed the kernel of a group homomorphism and the special role of normal subgroups and quotient groups, but we have not at all discussed exact sequences.\n\n\nImportant concepts\n\nSet, subset, intersection, union\nMap, domain, codomain, argument, image, injective, surjective, bijective\nSet cardinality: finite, countably infinite, uncountable \\(=\\) uncountably infinite\nEquivalence relation (and partial order relation)\nBinary operation, associativity, commutativity, neutral element and inverses\nGroup, subgroup\nStructure preserving map \\(=\\) homomorphism, isomorphism, endomorphism, automorphism group\nkernel of a group homomorphism, normal subgroup\nPermutation, parity or signature of permutation\nRing, field\nVector space, linear combination, linear span, complete set, linear independence, basis, dimension, coordinates (coordinate isomorphism)\nLinear map, linear operator, linear transformation, general linear group\nSubspace, disjoint subspaces, direct sum, complement, codimension, quotient space,\nAlgebra, commutator\n\n\n\nLemmas, propositions and theorems\nNo proofs from Chapter 1\n\n\nFor applications / exercises\nUnderstanding the concepts and being able to recognise the relevant structures for exercises and examples"
